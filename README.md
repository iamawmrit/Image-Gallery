# Gallery

A modern, high-performance, and privacy-focused image gallery for macOS.

Built because the default macOS gallery didn't meet my needs for speed and flexibility. Gallery is designed to be fast, beautiful, and completely local.

## Features

- **🚀 Blazing Fast**: Built with Electron and optimized for performance. Handles thousands of images effortlessly.
- **🔒 Private & Local**: Your photos never leave your device. No cloud syncing, no tracking.
- **✨ Masonry Grid**: View your collection in a stunning, responsive masonry layout.
- **🎨 Powerful Editor**: Built-in image editor with adjustments (brightness, contrast, saturation), filters, cropping, and drawing tools.
- **📂 Sidebar Navigation**: Organize and browse your folders with a native-feeling sidebar.
- **⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts**: Navigate and edit with efficiency.
- **🌙 Dark Mode**: Sleek dark interface that's easy on the eyes.
